# Elevator Simulator C++

This is a simple Elevator Simulator.

The **left column** demonstrates the calls. Each time you press a number ( 1 to 4) an elevator call is executed.  
The **right column** demonstrates the right-now position of elevator. The elevators will move to the levels until all elevator calls are done.
